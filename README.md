# Aim:
To learn how to use operators in c++

# Theory:
Operators in C++ are special symbols that perform specific operations on one or more values.The inputs can be decided my the end user while not having to write the same thing again for another value.

1.Arithmetic Operators: Perform arithmetic operations.

I. Addition + II. Subtraction - III. Multiplication * IV. Division / V. Modulus %

2.Relational Operators: Compare values and return boolean results.

I. Equal to == II. Not equal to != III. Less than < IV. Greater than > V. Less than or equal to <= VI. Greater than or equal to >=

3.Logical Operators: Combine boolean expressions.  

I. Logical AND && II. Logical OR || III. Logical NOT !

4.Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.

I. Simple assignment = II. Add and assign += III. Subtract and assign -= IV. Multiply and assign *= V. Divide and assign /=  VI. Modulus and assign %/

PORGRAM 1:
This C++ program checks whether a given integer is positive, zero, or negative. It performs the following steps:

1. Prompt User Input: The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. Condition Check: It evaluates whether the entered integer is non-negative (i.e., greater than or equal to zero).
3. Output Result:
   - If the integer is non-negative, it prints "The number is positive or zero."
   - If the integer is negative, it prints "The number is negative."
4. Program Termination: After displaying the result, the program ends with a return value of 0 to indicate successful execution.

This simple program demonstrates basic input and output operations, as well as conditional statements in C++.

PROGRAM 2:
This C++ program determines the quadrant of a point in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system based on its `x` and `y` coordinates. Here’s a detailed description of the program:

1. User Input: 
   - The program prompts the user to enter the `x` and `y` coordinates of a point.
   - It then reads these coordinates from the user input.

2. Quadrant Determination:
   - First Quadrant: If both `x` and `y` are positive (`x > 0` and `y > 0`), the program outputs "The number is in the first quadrant."
   - Second Quadrant: If `x` is negative and `y` is positive (`x < 0` and `y > 0`), it outputs "The number is in the second quadrant."
   - Third Quadrant: If both `x` and `y` are negative (`x < 0` and `y < 0`), it outputs "The number is in the third quadrant."
   - Fourth Quadrant: If `x` is positive and `y` is negative (`x > 0` and `y < 0`), it outputs "The number is in the fourth quadrant."

3. Output: Based on the conditions, the program prints which quadrant the point belongs to.

 Key Points:
- The program uses conditional statements to evaluate the position of the point relative to the origin and determine the appropriate quadrant.
- Note that the program does not handle the cases where the point lies on the axes (i.e., where `x` or `y` is zero).

This program effectively illustrates the use of basic conditional logic to classify a point’s location in a coordinate system.

PROGRAM 3:
This C++ program calculates and assigns a grade based on the average marks obtained in five subjects. Here’s a detailed description:

User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter the marks for five subjects.
It reads these marks from the user input.
Average Calculation:
M=M1+M2+MM3+M4+M5/5
This average is then used to determine the grade.
Grade Assignment:
Grade O: If the average is 90 or above, it prints "The grade is O."
Grade A+: If the average is greater than 80 but less than 90, it prints "The grade is A+."
Grade A: If the average is greater than 70 but less than 80, it prints "The grade is A."
Grade B: If the average is greater than 60 but less than 70, it prints "The grade is B."
Grade F: If the average is 60 or below, it prints "The grade is F.

PROGRAM 4:
This C++ program reverses and prints the digits of a given integer. Here's a detailed description of how the program works:

User Input:

The program prompts the user to enter an integer n.
It reads this integer from the user input.
Digit Extraction and Printing:

The program uses a while loop to process the integer while n is greater than zero.
Inside the loop:
The last digit of n is extracted using the modulus operation (n % 10). This digit is stored in the variable x.
The digit x is then printed.
The integer n is updated by removing its last digit using integer division by 10 (n = n / 10).
Loop Execution:

The loop continues until n becomes zero. Each iteration extracts and prints the next digit from the end of the number.
Key Points:
Reverse Order: The digits of the number are printed in reverse order because the modulus operation retrieves the least significant digit first.
Termination: The loop terminates when n becomes zero, indicating that all digits have been processed and printed.
